Scrapbook is an Instagram-like social media site where users can upload, view, and comment on pictures. Scrapbook is geared toward photographers and other creatives in the photography realm. It doesn't force the user to crop their photos into a specific ratio, giving users the freedom to share their work without altering it. Scrapbook also features a communal feed so that you can easily discover new artists.

###Next steps
In the future, I would like to add functionality that would enable a user to like other's photos. I would also like to add a user profile so that users can see photographer's uploads all in one place. I would also be nice to allow users to add friends or follow other profiles.
